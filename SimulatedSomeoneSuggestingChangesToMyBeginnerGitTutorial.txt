"Hey, I know you want to use processing but there is no easy way that I can find to get user input from the person.  I may just finish up this little tutorial with what I can do and then do another one of these using the Eclipse IDE and Java."

"Hey, check out the functions of the println() by typing it in and then hitting Ctrl+Space. (Sketch files in processing language IDE)

"Hey add something about how version control is helpful to you"

I just remembered that this is not the changed file in the actual repository, this is actually just having a file TO BE pushed to the main. This is the stage right before the actual passing around documents in collaboration

I am not for sure what I changed by hitting the green and red spaces betweent the head file and the working file.  I will have to learn how to "checkout" a file or look at a previous commit.
